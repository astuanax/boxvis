HTML Box Visualizer

A pure JavaScript based CSS / HTML element visualizer / debugger.  Similar to Chrome's developer tools, this allows you to visualize an element and all of its layout properties in one place.  Add it to any page and move the mouse around the screen.  This tool has no effect on the functionality of your application, but still displays information on any element you mouse over.
